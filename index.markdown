# Mindful Month
<p class="subtitle">Month of awareness, good habits, and self-love</p>

Hi! I'm [Ksenia](https://kseniailinyh.github.io/), and this is my mindfulness project that I created with my friends in 2017. It started as a mailing list designed to teach people how to live a calm and happy life.

Think of it as an advent calendar, but instead of sweets, you get a short, easy task for each day of the month. These tasks include meditating for 5 minutes, avoiding phone use for a day, practicing gratitude, and more. Many of these tasks have the potential to become lasting habits.

Originally, this was distributed as a newsletter, but the platform I used suspended my account. So, I've decided to share these messages here instead. Using AI, I've translated all the content and created new accompanying images.

More than 3000 people subscribed and shared feedback like the following:

*— This advent calendar is just a bomb. I think it should be exhibited in the museum of new media. It’s like augmented reality, just not another stupid game on an iPhone, but something meaningful.*

*— Thank you! I really liked your idea, and I did most of the exercises. There is more order in life*

*— Thank you! Thanks to your course, I was inspired and deleted the application in contact from my phone! And I can say that life without an app is great! Thanks! And I feel that this is not the last change — I found an android application, QualityTime, which tracks the running applications and the time of their use. Still waiting for me optimization!*

## Write down what you most want

Remember what you truly want.

Choose a time for this practice — 10-15 minutes. When you won't be disturbed. This time is needed for reflection.

What do you want? Try to answer this question specifically, rather than the question "What would be the right thing to do?". What is it that you've been dreaming of for a long time but haven't done?

Write down all the answers that come to your mind. Youthful dreams, current materialistic desires, and dreams of world achievements are all equally suitable. The main thing is that you really want it. If the thought of it takes your breath away, or even makes you a little scared — that's what you need.

Now think about what needs to be done to make it possible. What specifically needs to be done?

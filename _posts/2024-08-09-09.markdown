## Leave your phone at home

Live one day without your phone. Leave it at home.

You won't be constantly checking your phone and worrying about messages and notifications. You'll have a much calmer day if you don't immediately know that someone has messaged you.

You can respond to messages when you're at your workplace, not all day long. Not in the car, not in the kitchen, not at a meeting, but only at your workplace. This is possible because most messages don't require an immediate response. If you react in an hour instead of immediately, no one will die.

Try a "soft" option if you absolutely can't be out of touch with your loved ones:
- Turn off your phone for half a day and let people know you'll be unavailable for some time;
- Turn off notifications on your phone. Keep calls, but only from people on your "Favorites" list.

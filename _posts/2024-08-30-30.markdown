## Thank you and goodbye

We wanted to introduce you to habits and practices that help you live mindfully. If you've tried at least three - that's good. If at least one stays with you - that's wonderful, it means we didn't do this in vain.

### What to do with these practices next

Much of the Mindful Month can be practiced daily, and sooner or later it will become a habit and part of your life. The more you practice something, the greater effect you get. For example, the longer you practice meditation, the more calmness and mindfulness appears in each day, not just during and immediately after practice.

Other practices are habits that are useful to do from time to time. For example, walks, not using social media, decluttering.

The calendar covered various topics: mindfulness, information consumption, decluttering things and tasks, relationships with loved ones, useful habits, and so on. Now choose what you liked the most, what resonated with you the deepest. Continue doing it, think about how to integrate it into your life. Consider what habit you want to acquire after this one.

We wanted to show you a lot and let you try many things, so we were superficial and didn't always explain the essence of what was happening. Actually, there's nothing wrong with that, because practice comes first. But if you're interested in a particular topic, you can study it and understand more deeply what's going on.

This is the last letter of the month of mindfulness.

Thank you for being with us this month, we hope you enjoyed it.

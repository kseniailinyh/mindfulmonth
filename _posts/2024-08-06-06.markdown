## Be with yourself for half an hour

Sometimes we have too many things to do - we just move from one task to another from the moment we wake up until we run out of energy. There's no time to simply catch our breath. But we need to allocate time for this - to put our thoughts in order, to come to a solution for a long-standing problem, to unload our mind.

Take a break. Set aside half an hour to be alone with yourself. Choose a place where no one will disturb you. Turn off your phone, or leave it somewhere else. Just you and your thoughts. If you've been wanting to find time for yourself for a while - here's your chance. It's allowed on this day.

Stay in silence. Think about what happened today. Don't analyze your actions, don't criticize yourself. Think about what you want.

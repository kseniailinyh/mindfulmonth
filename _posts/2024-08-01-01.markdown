## Get some rest

Hello!

This is the "Month of Mindfulness" newsletter. We created it together: Vladimir Kutovoy, Ksenia Ilinykh, and Igor Lukanin. We work in IT and live mindful lives.

Over the past couple of years, we've read many books on mindfulness, minimalism, and essentialism. About proper sleep and how to manage work without sacrificing rest. This knowledge helps to be happier, feel better, find time for favorite activities, and experience life more vividly. We thought, "What a pity they don't teach this in school".

That's why we decided to create a project-newsletter about mindfulness, good habits, and self-love. Every day you will receive an email with a task — what to do and what it gives you.

Most practices can be done every day. If you like something, keep doing it. If you wanted to do a practice but forgot, no worries — do it another day.

Everything we write about, we've tried ourselves.

Today's task without explanation: simply rest.

## Don't check social media

For several days, we've been trying to live ordinary moments mindfully. Now we'll be tidying up our information flow. The food we eat affects how we feel and what we're made of. The same goes for the information we consume.

To start, spend a day without social media. Nothing terrible will happen if you don't find out today what's going on with a few dozen acquaintances. Instead, you'll have more time for yourself.

It's easy to "slip up" and open Facebook out of habit, so put in place a couple of "safeguards":

- Turn off notifications from social media apps, or delete them â€” you can reinstall them tomorrow if you want;
- Fill your free time with useful and enjoyable activities. Take a walk or read a book. Chat with colleagues during lunch. Talk with your loved ones in the evening. Watch the sunset if the weather permits.

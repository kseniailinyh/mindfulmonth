## Delete social media apps

Make your phone a useful tool, not a time-wasting device. Use your phone only when you need to talk to someone. To avoid the temptation of mindlessly staring at your phone, delete social media apps from it. These are the most common companions of procrastination and lost time.

This might be scary and unfamiliar, but trust me â€” it's better without them. The next time you catch yourself thinking about checking social media, you won't have the opportunity to do it right away. Instead, you'll have the chance to do something useful.

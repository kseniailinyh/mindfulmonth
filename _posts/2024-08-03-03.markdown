## Brush your teeth consciously

Yesterday we tried meditating - spending 5 minutes observing our breath. But we can also live ordinary moments mindfully.

Try to brush your teeth mindfully. To do this, simply pay attention to all sensations.

Observe everything that happens. Watch how you turn on the faucet, pick up the toothbrush. How you put it under the water and how the stream envelops it. How you take the tube in your hands and apply the toothpaste. Monitor your sensations while brushing your teeth.

What do you feel? Was it different from usual?

When you live ordinary moments mindfully, life becomes brighter, more flavorful, fuller. You get more sensations in the same amount of time. In a sense, life becomes longer.

## Spend the day offline

We continue our week of mindful information consumption. Let's reinforce our achievements with a more challenging task.

Today will be an offline day. Don't use your computer, spend the day without your phone.

If you leave home, leave your phone behind to avoid temptation. Try to relax and feel the freedom from your phone. You don't need to check your phone every half hour or get upset about news. You don't need to rush to answer a non-urgent question. Feel how wonderful it is to simply live and not worry.

If you can't manage to spend the whole day without your phone, leave it at home for at least a couple of hours. Go for a walk or go shopping and take only your wallet and house keys.

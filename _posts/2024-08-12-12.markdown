## Don't read or watch the news

Good news rarely makes headlines, which is why news agencies focus on the negative. By reading news feeds every day, you unconsciously concentrate on the bad. This affects your mood and well-being.

Think about it: do you really want to read every day about someone being killed, someone stealing something, how much money was embezzled somewhere, and so on? You can live without these news stories.

If something important happens, you'll hear about it from people around you. This is much more interesting - you'll be able to discuss the news and learn another person's opinion.

Tomorrow, don't open news websites and apps, don't turn on the TV.

If you open them out of habit - no worries, just close them right away.

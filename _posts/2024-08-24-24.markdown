## Call a friend or relative you haven't talked to for a long time

Sometimes we don't communicate with loved ones due to everyday reasons, like moving to another city. Sometimes because of this, the connection begins to fade.

Choose a close person you haven't talked to in a long time and give them a call. Just like that, without any particular reason. Don't create any expectations beforehand.

It could be an old friend or a relative. Who exactly doesn't matter, as long as you have pleasant feelings when you think about this person.

Don't start the conversation with a blame game like "Why don't you call or write?" or "Where have you been?". Don't be shy to say if you're happy to hear them and have missed them.

## Have lunch without a phone

Have lunch without your phone. Simply turn off the sound and leave your phone in another room. You'll be able to experience this hour more fully - observing life around you, eating, talking with loved ones. And being here and now.

Don't worry if someone calls or messages you during this time. If you don't respond immediately, nothing will happen - you can respond later.

If it's more convenient, move this practice to dinner. The specific time doesn't matter; the main thing is to enjoy and be present in the moment.

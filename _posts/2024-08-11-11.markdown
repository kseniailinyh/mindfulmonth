## Clean up your social media feeds

Social media is not evil. There are many intelligent, profound people who share their experiences, thoughts, and talk about what matters to them. But at the same time, there's a lot of self-admiration, fakery, and negativity. Often, people want to appear better than they are. They publish carefully curated photos and boast about their achievements. The efforts they put in remain behind the scenes, and it seems that everyone around is successful, beautiful, and smart. Unfollow people who seem insincere to you.

Don't waste time and attention on posts from people who:

- Constantly complain,
- Who you find unpleasant

Open your social media apps â€” it's allowed today, and unfollow people you've been reluctant to read all this time.

## Unsubscribe from newsletters

We continue to reduce the information flow by eliminating unnecessary things.

Today, we're focusing on email. Unsubscribe from newsletters you don't read. Especially from those you want to read but don't have time for. This will help you avoid wasting time sorting through emails and regretting that you're falling behind again.

Start by unsubscribing from newsletters that have arrived in the last couple of days. Go through them and click on the "Unsubscribe" link in each email. The link is usually hidden in the footer. Don't stop, keep unsubscribing.

Then unsubscribe as new emails come in. If you get a newsletter from a service you don't even remember - toss it out. Right now, it's only serving to remind you of this service once every few months. It's a useless waste of attention.

In the end, you'll only receive emails that are truly interesting. This will make dealing with email easier, adding calm and order to your life.

## Chocolate Meditation

Chocolate meditation is a pleasant way to learn how to enjoy simple things.

Take your favorite chocolate, milk or dark - it doesn't matter. Break off a small piece. Feel it in your hand, inhale its aroma. Place it on your tongue. Don't chew, let the chocolate melt in your mouth. Taste it and savor every moment.

If you don't have chocolate on hand, do this with something else you love, like raisins.

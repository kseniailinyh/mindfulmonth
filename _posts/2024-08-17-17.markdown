## Clean up the workplace

For the next four days, we will be tidying up and continuing to get rid of unnecessary items.

You see everything that surrounds you. Even when you're not looking directly at an object and it's just in your field of vision, you still see it. Then it becomes a reason for shifting your attention, for example, from a work task to thoughts about buying new headphones. Or about how it's time for a cup of tea. Or about how it's time for a vacation. That's how the brain works. A "clean" desk helps you avoid distractions and use less mental fuel.

Remove items that are not necessary for work:

- Take used sheets of paper to be recycled or throw them in the bin;
- Take dirty mugs to the kitchen;
- Throw away or put away in a drawer the remaining items.

Keep only what you need within reach: a notebook and pen for notes, a bottle or glass of water. Everything is good in moderation, so keep a family photo.

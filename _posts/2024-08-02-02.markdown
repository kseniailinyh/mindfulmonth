## Meditate for 5 minutes

Mindfulness begins with meditation.

Meditation is the concentration of attention on one thing. In the moment, it helps to relax, put thoughts in order, and be here and now. Regular practice helps to worry less, trains attention, and adds mindfulness. It's also a great way to be alone with yourself.

You'll need a place where no one will disturb you, a chair, and a timer on your phone. And your breath.

Set the timer for 5 minutes and choose a non-alarming sound. Sit down, start the timer, and place your hands on your knees. Take a deep breath in and a deep breath out, then close your eyes. Now just breathe. Calmly, steadily.

Don't resist if various thoughts come to mind - let them pass. Don't worry if it doesn't work out - it's impossible to meditate incorrectly.

When the timer rings, don't rush, gently open your eyes. What do you feel?

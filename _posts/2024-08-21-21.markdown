## Take a walk

Go for a walk just because.

Not on your way to the store, but just go out for a walk. Not for 15 or 30 or 60 minutes, but for as long as you want.

Choose and set aside time for this.

At the appointed hour — get up and go.

During the walk, you don't need to do anything special. If you want to be here and now and spend this time mindfully — be. If you want to think about a task that has been on your mind for a while — think. The main thing is to take a walk and be with yourself.

And yes, dress for the weather.
